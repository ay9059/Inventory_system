=======

# Our store stocks and sells basic fishing equipment.
# We assume that fishing rods and reels are "parts"
# that are readily available from a local distributor.

addPart P.rod                                 # fishing rod
addPart P.reel                                # fishing reel

# A fishing pole can be assembled from a rod and a reel.
# Our store has a bin capable of holding up to 12 poles.

addAssembly A.pole 12 P.rod 1 P.reel 1        # a fishing pole (rod+reel)

# We call bait a "part", though there might be a better term for this.
# We assume that bait is readily available to put into a tacklebox

addPart P.bait                                # bait to fish with

# A license is an "assembly". We are legally allowed
# to have as many as 20 licenses on hand at any one time.

addAssembly A.license 20                      # fishing licenses

# We can assemble a tackle box using one spare reel and 20 baits.
# We have a bin capable of holding up to 5 tackleboxes.

addAssembly A.tacklebox 5 P.reel 1 P.bait 20  # holds a spare reel and bait

# The term "tackle" refers to a set consisting of a tacklebox and a pole.
# We have a bin capable of holding up to 4 tackle sets.

addAssembly A.tackle 4 A.tacklebox 1 A.pole 1 # fishing equipment sets

# First, we fill the bins (all of them start out empty).

restock                                       # fill the bins

# The output of this request shows how many assemblies have been
# made to restock the bins, and how many "parts" were required to make them.
# Let's look at our current inventory (no parts, just assemblies).
# Everything should now be full!

inventory

# A customer arrives and asks to purchase 10 tackle sets and 10 licenses

fulfillOrder A.tackle 10 A.license 10         # 10 tackle sets and 10 licenses

# The output of this request shows how many assemblies have been
# made to fulfill the order (first using any assemblies that are on hand)
# and how many "parts" were required to make them.
# What's left in our inventory after the order is fulfilled?

# Let's restock any bins that are getting low ...
